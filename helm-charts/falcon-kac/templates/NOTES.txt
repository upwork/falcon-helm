Thank you for installing the CrowdStrike Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller!

Note that in order for the Falcon Kubernetes Admissions Controller to run, the
falcon-kac image must be present in a container registry accessible to the 
kubernetes deployment.

When utilizing your own registry, a common error on installation is forgetting
to add your containerized sensor to your local image registry prior to 
executing `helm install`. Please read the Helm Chart's readme for more 
deployment considerations.

To check the status of Falcon Kubernetes Admissions Controller pods, run the 
following command:

  kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods
